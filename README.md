 https://lavinia-81.github.io/Calculator/

Welcome to the **Calculator** repository! This project features a simple calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the calculator interface.
- **CSS**: Handles the styling and layout of the calculator.
- **JavaScript**: Adds the functionality to perform basic arithmetic operations.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Use the buttons on the calculator to input numbers and perform operations.
3. The calculator supports the following operations:
   - Addition (`+`)
   - Subtraction (`-`)
   - Multiplication (`*`)
   - Division (`/`)
   - Percentage (`%`)
   - Clear (`AC`)
   - Delete (`DEL`)
   - Decimal point (`.`)
   - Equals (`=`) to calculate the result

## Key Concepts

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the calculator looks great on all devices.
- **Event Handling**: Uses JavaScript to add events to elements for a dynamic user experience.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations.
